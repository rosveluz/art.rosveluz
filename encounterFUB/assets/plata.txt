A Century of Art Deco

Let’s go back to the year 1928.

Escolta Street was the beating heart of commerce in Manila—buzzing with traders, diplomats, and department stores. It was here that a building rose—a structure that would become a symbol of ambition, elegance, and endurance. It was called the Perez-Samanillo Building, now known as the First United Building.

This wasn’t just another office block. It was Manila’s tallest building at the time, and a visual marvel. Designed by Andrés Luna de San Pedro, the son of Filipino painter Juan Luna, it carried the distinct marks of Art Deco—a style sweeping across the modern cities of the world.¹

Think bold lines.  
Geometric patterns.  
Wrought iron details.  
Even the elevator had an antique dial, adding flair to function.²

Inside, it welcomed Manila’s elite. Offices, showrooms, consulates. Riu Hermanos, Erlanger & Galinger, and eventually, in 1936, the iconic Berg’s Department Store all called it home.³⁴

The city government even awarded it the title of “Most Beautiful Office Building” in Manila upon its completion.¹

But beauty alone doesn’t guarantee survival.

In the 1940s, war came to the city. During the Battle of Manila in 1945, much of Escolta was flattened. Buildings collapsed. History was lost. But the Perez-Samanillo Building endured. Damaged, yes. Scarred, definitely. But it stood.⁵

After the war, Manila rebuilt—and so did the building. In 1951, businessman Sy Lian Teng took over Berg’s Department Store, and by 1968, the entire structure was renamed the First United Building. Its legacy was passed from the Samanillos to the Cojuangcos, and eventually back to the Sylianteng family.⁴

Through the 1970s and '80s, the upper floors came alive with movie studios. This was the home of Dolphy’s RVQ Productions, Nora Aunor’s NV Production, and more. Escolta was no longer just a business district—it was part of Philippine cinema’s creative pulse.⁶

But time was not always kind.

By the 1990s and early 2000s, Escolta had faded. Shiny malls elsewhere drew the crowds. The once-grand buildings stood silent. Yet even then, the First United Building refused to disappear.

In 2015, a new chapter began.

The family opened the First United Building Community Museum, a tribute to the past. Then, in 2016, they launched HUB: Make Lab—transforming the old Berg’s space into a home for local creatives, indie retailers, cafés, and art studios.⁴⁷ The architecture was preserved. The spirit was reborn.

Today, nearly a century since it was built, the First United Building is more than just a structure.

It’s a bridge between eras. A survivor of war. A canvas of design. A container of memory.  
And now, a platform for community and creativity.

It reminds us:  
Great architecture isn’t just about how a building looks—  
it’s about what it lives through, and who it continues to serve.
