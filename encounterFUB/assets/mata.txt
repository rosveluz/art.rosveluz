A Building That Endured

Let’s begin in the shadows of war.

It’s 1945, and the Battle of Manila has reduced the city to ruin. Escolta—once the vibrant avenue of commerce and culture—lies in ash and silence. Entire blocks are flattened. Fire has gutted homes. Art and archives have vanished. Over 100,000 civilians have been killed in one of the most destructive urban battles of World War II.¹

And yet—somehow—the Perez-Samanillo Building remains standing.

Damaged, yes. Scarred, undeniably. But still upright—like a witness too stubborn to forget.

Inside its walls had lived stories of ambition: department stores, consulates, and offices where working-class Filipinos and immigrants carved out a life. One of them was Juan, an employee of Berg’s Department Store, who, during the Japanese occupation, secretly funneled money to guerrilla fighters—risking his life under the nose of his Spanish manager, who turned out to be a collaborator. After liberation, the manager was executed by local guerrillas.²

Not all acts of bravery make it into textbooks—but some remain in the bones of buildings.

In 1951, Berg’s was purchased by Sy Lian Teng, a Chinese-Filipino entrepreneur who rebuilt and revitalized the store. By 1968, the building was renamed the First United Building, and came under the ownership of the Cojuangco family, before returning to the Syliantengs in later decades.³⁴

But even as new ownership promised progress, the old systems endured.

Feudal landholding structures, concentrated wealth, and political dynasties remained untouched. As rural livelihoods collapsed, waves of internal migrants flowed into Manila, only to face urban poverty and displacement. The divide between center and periphery deepened. Feudalism had not ended—it had simply moved into high-rise form.⁵

Then came 1972. Martial law.

Declared by President Ferdinand Marcos, it suspended civil liberties, suppressed media, and institutionalized authoritarian rule for nearly a decade.⁶ Dissent was criminalized. Torture and disappearances became state weapons. Even the streets of Escolta—once commercial and cosmopolitan—grew tense and quiet.

And still, the First United Building stood. Not as a monument to the regime, nor as an icon of resistance—but as a neutral shell that carried on.

Within it, however, something more human survived: film.

In the 1970s and ‘80s, film companies like RVQ Productions—founded by Dolphy—and Nora Aunor’s NV Productions moved in. The building became a vertical studio, hosting creativity behind closed doors while repression ruled outside.⁷

Then came 1986. The People Power Revolution.

Millions filled EDSA. The Marcos regime fell. Democracy returned—or seemed to. But the deeper inequalities persisted. Land reform stalled. Dynasties regrouped. And free-market capitalism became the new gospel. Manila filled with malls, condos, outsourcing centers—and rising levels of poverty and exclusion.⁸

Escolta, once elite, now stood outside the economic boom. Its decay mirrored that of a city caught between nostalgia and neglect.

Still, the building remained.

In 2015, the First United Building Community Museum opened—honoring Berg’s, the Sy Lian Teng family, and the layered history of the space. In 2016, HUB: Make Lab brought in artists, designers, and small retailers—reanimating the ground floor not through spectacle, but with care and memory.⁴⁹

Today, nearly a century since it was built, the First United Building still lives on.

It has stood through colonialism, war, dictatorship, revolution, and capitalism unbound.  
It has sheltered privilege and poverty. It has heard laughter, silence, gunfire, and protest.  
It is not just a structure of concrete and ornament.  
It is a structure of endurance.  
And like the city around it, it still wrestles with what it remembers—and what it must become.

It reminds us:  
A city is not only shaped by what it builds—  
but by what it refuses to forget.
