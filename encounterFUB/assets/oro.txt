A Century of Legacy: The First United Building

In the golden years of prewar Manila, when Escolta was still the city’s most glamorous street, a new landmark rose above the bustling horse-drawn carriages and electric trams: the Perez-Samanillo Building.

Commissioned by Luis Perez Samanillo, a prominent landowner of Spanish descent, the building was completed in 1928, at a time when Escolta was considered the commercial heart of the Philippines. It was a bold and beautiful structure—the tallest in Manila when it opened, designed by Andrés Luna de San Pedro, the son of Filipino painter Juan Luna and a rising architect known for merging European modernism with local flair.¹

The building’s Art Deco façade, accented by wrought iron staircases, grand geometric ornamentation, and even a vintage elevator with an antique dial, reflected not just aesthetic trends of the era, but also the city’s aspirations to become a modern Asian capital. For its design, it was awarded the title of “Most Beautiful Office Building” by the City of Manila that same year.¹

From the very beginning, the Perez-Samanillo Building attracted Manila’s commercial elite.

Among its early tenants were the upscale leather goods shop Riu Hermanos, the American trading company Erlanger & Galinger, and by 1936, the iconic Berg’s Department Store, which would go on to become one of Escolta’s most beloved shopping destinations.²³

The building also housed foreign consulates—including those of France and Panama—a sign of Escolta’s international prestige at the time.⁴

But the building’s grandeur would soon be tested by history.

In 1942, during the Japanese occupation of Manila, Berg’s remained in operation—but at great risk. According to family accounts, one employee named Juan secretly gave money to guerrilla fighters, unaware that his Spanish manager was collaborating with Japanese forces. After the Battle of Manila in 1945, the collaborator was executed by local guerrillas. The building itself was heavily damaged during the urban warfare that leveled much of the city, yet it remained structurally intact, one of the few survivors on Escolta.⁵

The postwar years brought both restoration and reinvention.

In 1951, Sy Lian Teng, a Chinese-Filipino businessman, acquired Berg’s Department Store from its original owners and revitalized its operations. By 1968, the building itself was sold to the Cojuangco family, and officially renamed the First United Building. A decade later, full ownership was returned to the Sylianteng family, who remain stewards of the property to this day.⁶

From the 1970s to the 1980s, the First United Building found new life as a hub for the Philippine film industry.

On its upper floors, film companies like RVQ Productions (founded by Dolphy), Nora Aunor’s NV Productions, GC Films, and Essex Films operated studios and offices. Escolta’s historical elegance had begun to fade by then, but inside this building, a creative renaissance quietly took place.⁷

Time, however, was not always kind.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, Escolta fell into decline as commercial activity shifted to newer districts like Makati and Ortigas. Malls replaced boutiques. The old grandeur faded. But the First United Building refused to vanish. It stood—weathered, but waiting.

Then, in 2015, the family behind the building unveiled the First United Building Community Museum. It was both a tribute to the memory of Berg’s and an effort to keep Escolta’s layered history alive.⁶

The following year, in 2016, a new initiative took root: HUB: Make Lab—a creative incubation space that invited young artists, entrepreneurs, and designers to occupy the former Berg’s space. With new cafés like The Den, vintage shops, and indie makers breathing life into its halls, the building became a cornerstone of Escolta’s ongoing cultural revival.⁸

Nearly a century since it first opened its doors, the First United Building remains a fixture of Manila’s urban memory.

It has survived colonialism, war, economic decline, and political transformation—not as a static monument, but as a living, evolving space. It’s a rare case where architecture hasn’t just outlasted history—it’s adapted with it.

It reminds us that legacy isn’t carved in stone—it’s carried in what survives.
